## General info

We are the members of workshops from Software Development Academy (SDA). Our group had 40-class-hours to finish assumed mvp. The project was created in a four-person team. To created this apllication we create around 50'ty branches so far. At the beginning, our goal was to create a website that allows drawing numbers and typing them. Unfortunately, we have noticed that such an application will require more work from us than we assumed. So we created a simple game that allows users to draw one number and guess it. 
For now it is MVP realization. Our team plans to develop this project systematically. There are still areas that need to be perfected. The next goal is to implement our original assumption. During this project we improved technical knowledge and due to the teamwork we reafine: communication skills, listen carefully and openness to suggestions, tips and ideas of others.
